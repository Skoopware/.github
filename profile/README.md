## ðŸš€ How to Add a Repository to the Organization  

When creating a new repository under **Skoopflow**, please follow these steps:  

1. **Create a new repository** under the organization.  
2. **Set the repository visibility** (public or private) based on its purpose.  
3. **Initialize the repository with a README** (or add one later).  
4. **Use the provided `.gitignore` file** to ensure unnecessary files are not committed.  
5. **Follow our naming conventions** for repository names.  

### ðŸ“Œ Adding the `.gitignore` File  
Every repository **must include** our standard `.gitignore` file to avoid committing unnecessary files (e.g., dependencies, environment variables, build artifacts).  

ðŸ“¥ **Download or copy the `.gitignore` file from**:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Skoopflow Standard .gitignore](./gitignore-template)
